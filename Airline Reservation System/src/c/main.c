    *   Airline reservation system represents a software which can be used to create a passenger and scheduled flight objects providing all details for each
    *       and making a reservation for a particular passenger. Any scheduled flight can be cancelled, while both objects can be edited at anytime.
    *   All information about passenger or schedulled flight can be seen, as well as all reservations for a particular passenger.
    *   Software has been made to be robust, providing input validations which will prevent the program to take bad inputs. In other words, no invalid data can be inputted
